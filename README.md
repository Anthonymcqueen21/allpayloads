# allpayloads
These are payloads to hunt for various bugs in web applications. from SQLi, xss, RCE to path traversal and more with XSS and fuzzing.
You can find these payloads useful while learning my courses and also while you are going for penetration test to automate the task and find the bugs. Either you are a bug bounty hunter or a web application penetration tester.
